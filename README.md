# Unsupervised-ConceptDrift-JIT-SDP

Just-in-Time Software Defect Prediction (JIT-SDP) is a critical task in software engineering aimed at identifying defect-prone code changes at the time of their submission. This project integrates an **unsupervised concept drift detection framework** with a JIT-SDP model to enhance its robustness and adaptability to dynamic and evolving data distributions, ensuring reliable defect prediction over time.

## Introduction

Modern software development involves rapidly changing environments, often causing traditional defect prediction models to degrade in performance due to **concept drift** â€” changes in the underlying data distribution over time. This project:
- Enhances JIT-SDP using **unsupervised concept drift detection**.
- Adapts models in real-time to evolving data without relying on labeled data.
- Combines deep learning embeddings with statistical drift detection techniques to maintain prediction reliability.

The implemented framework leverages techniques to detect and characterize data drift while ensuring real-time adaptability for software defect prediction.
